After you set up Fastly services on your {{ site.data.var.ece }} project environments, you can use the custom VCL snippets feature to block [referral spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referrer_spam) from your sites.

The following example shows how to use a [Fastly Edge Dictionary](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/edge-dictionaries/working-with-dictionaries-using-the-api) with a custom VCL snippet to redirect incoming requests from a {{ site.data.var.ee }} store (`staging.example.com`) to a separate WordPress site (`customer.example.com`) that hosts related content like blog posts and customer stories.


{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
We recommend adding custom VCL configurations to a Staging environment where you can test them before running against Production.

**Prerequisites**

-  Configure your {{ site.var.data.ece }} environment for Fastly services. See [Set up Fastly]({{ page.baseurl }}/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html). 

-  Get credentials to access both the Fastly API and the Admin UI for your {{ site.data.var.ece }} environment.

-  Identify the URL paths that you want to redirect to the WordPress backend.

-  Use the Fastly API to add the following configuration settings to the Fastly service configuration: 

   -  Add the WordPress host to the Fastly backend configuration, for example `customer.example.com`.

   -  Attach the following request condition to the Wordpress backend.

     ```json
      req.http.X-WP == “1”
     ```
	 Incoming requests that match this condition, which is set through the custom VCL snippet, redirect to the WordPress backend. 
	 
     See the [Fastly API reference](https://docs.fastly.com/api/config#) for details on configuring the backend and request condition.

## Create an Edge Dictionary of WordPress paths {#edge-dictionary}

Edge Dictionaries create key-value pairs accessible to VCL functions during VCL snippet processing. In this example, you create an edge dictionary that provides the list of URL paths that you want to redirect from your store to the WordPress backend. 

1.  Log in to the Admin UI for your {{ site.data.var.ece }} project environment.

1.  Navigate to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System**.

1.  In the right pane, expand the following sections: **Full Page Cache** > **Fastly Configuration** > **Edge dictionaries**.

1.  Create the Dictionary container:

    - Click **Add container**.

    -  On the *Container* page, enter a **Dictionary name**. For this example, use the name `wordpress_urls`.

    -  Select **Activate after the change** to enable the dictionary after you create it.

    -  Click **Upload** to attach the dictionary to your Fastly service configuration.

1.  Add the list of URLs for redirection to the the `wordpress_urls` dictionary:

    -  Click the Settings icon for the `wordpress_urls` dictionary.

       ![Configure Edge Dictionary]

    -  Add and save key-value pairs in the new dictionary. For this example, each **Key** is a URL path that you want to redirect to the WordPress backend, and the **Value** is 1.
       
	   ![Add Edge Dictionary Items]
	 
    -  Click **Cancel** to return to the system configuration page.

## Create a VCL snippet for the WordPress redirect {#vcl}

The following custom VCL snippet code (JSON format) evaluates incoming requests and redirects those with a path a 
included in the `wordpress_urls` edge dictionary to the WordPress backend specified in the Fastly service configuration.


```json
{
  "name": "wordpress_redirect",
  "dynamic": "0",
  "type": "recv",
  "priority": "5",
  "content": "if ( req.url.path ~ \"^\\/?([^\\/?]+)\") { if ( table.lookup(wordpress_urls, re.group.1, \"NOTFOUND\") != \"NOTFOUND\" ) { set req.http.X-WP = \"1\"; } }"
}
```

Review the code to determine if you need to change any values:

-  `name`—Name for the VCL snippet. For this example, we used the name `wordpress_redirect`.
  
-  `dynamic`—Value 0 indicates a [regular snippet](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/vcl-snippets/using-regular-vcl-snippets) that you upload to the versioned VCL for the Fastly configuration.

-  `priority`—Determines when the VCL snippet runs. The priority is set to 5 so that this snippet code runs before any of the default Magento VCL snippets (`magentomodule_*`) that have a priority of 50.

-  `type`—Specifies the location for inserting the generated snippet. This VCL is a `recv` snippet type which adds the snippet code to the `vcl_recv` subroutine below the default Fastly VCL code and above any objects.

-  `content`—When the VCL code in this example runs, it extracts the first part segment of the path `/mypath/someotherpath`, and then compares that path (`mypath`) to the values in the `wordpress_urls` dictionary. Requests with matching paths are redirected to the WordPress backend. See the [Fastly VCL reference](https://docs.fastly.com/vcl/reference/) for information about creating Fastly VCL code snippets.
 

You can add the custom VCL snippet to your Fastly service configuration from the Admin UI (requires Fastly module 1.2.58 or later). If you do not have access to the Admin UI, you can save the JSON code example in a file and upload it using the Fastly API. See [Creating a VCL snippet using the Fastly API](https://docs.fastly.com/vcl/vcl-snippets/using-regular-vcl-snippets/#via-the-api). 


## Add the custom VCL snippet

Complete these steps to add the custom VCL snippet from the Magento Admin UI:

1.  Navigate to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **System**.

1.  In the right pane, expand **Full Page Cache** > **Fastly Configuration** > **Custom VCL Snippets**.

1.  Click **Create Custom Snippet**.

1.  Add the VCL snippet values:

	- Enter the **Name** (`wordpress_redirect`).
	
	- Select the **Type** (`recv`).
	
	- Set the **Priority** (`5`)
	
	- Add the **VCL** snippet content:

      ```html
      if ( req.url.path ~ "^/?([^/?]+)")
	    {
		  if ( table.lookup(wordpress_urls, re.group.1, \"NOTFOUND\") != \"NOTFOUND\" )
	        {set req.http.X-WP = "1";
		    }
         }
      ```

1.  Click **Create** to generate the VCL snippet file with the name pattern `type_priority_name.vcl`, for example `recv_5_wordpress_redirect.vcl`

    ![Create VCL Snippet]
	
1.  After the page reloads, click **Upload VCL to Fastly** in the *Fastly Configuration* section to add the file to the Fastly service configuration.

1.  After the upload completes, refresh the cache according to the notification at the top of the page.

Fastly validates the updated version of the VCL code during the upload process. If the validation fails, edit your custom VCL snippet to fix the issue. Then, upload the VCL again.

Instead of manually uploading custom VCL snippets, you can add snippets to the `$MAGENTO_CLOUD_APP_DIR/var/vcl_snippets_custom` directory in your environment. Snippets in this directory upload automatically when you click *upload VCL to Fastly* in the Admin UI. See [Automated custom VCL snippets deployment](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/CUSTOM-VCL-SNIPPETS.md#automated-custom-vcl-snippets-deployment) in the Fastly CDN for Magento 2 module documentation.
